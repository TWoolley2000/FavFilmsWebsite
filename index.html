                    <p> This website is about my favourite movies and television shows. I created this website because I am passionate about media and wished to share my opinions with the world. movies allow me to feel different emotions; thrill, happiness, sadness, intensity, comfort, shock, nervous all these roller-coaster of emotions is one reason why i love watching movies and tv shows. Movies are a persisting phenomenon because of their recreational and cultural value; most people like movies simply because they enjoy the experience of watching them. People enjoy turning one life off for a short while and stepping into another - sometimes because life is rough, sometimes just for the sake of something new or different, sometimes just for a laugh. Personally, i prefer tv shows to movies overall as i enjoy world building and character development which you tend to find more of in tv shows due to the longer time they run for, i think the perfect format of media content is a 12 eps, 40 minutes each as this allows for good building of the series without overstaying its welcome and becoming stagnant. This is a benefit to movies too! As they can be 1 hour and 30 mins in length to 3 hours in length it means that they are concise and tend to get to the meat of the story quickly!</p>
