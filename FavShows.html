        <div class="Mando">
            <p>My favourite show at the moment is The mandalorian, a show set in the Star Wars universe, i enjoy the special effect and the characters but most of all i love the world building, the small details that expand our view into the star wars galaxy and the many alien races, the show has wonderful pacing and amazing plotlines that make you want more.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="StarTrek">
            <p>Another of my favourite shows is star trek: The next generation which follows the crew of the starship enterprise ina w oled full of hope and new things to explore, this is my comfort show when iâ€™m feeling down i turn to star trek the next generation as its a feel good show with wonderful interpersonal relationships and plotlines that show the good that humanity could become.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="House">
            <p>My final favourite show is House, which follows a troubled doctor who is a genius of diagnostic medicine and his many previously unsolvable medical cases, the show is loosely based on the adventures of sherlock holmes with Doctor house being a stand in for sherlock. I like this show due to its format of a story per episode as well as seeing the development of Dr House and his team over the years of working in the medical profession.</p>
