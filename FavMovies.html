        <div class="Shawshank">
            <p >One of my favourite movies of all time is ‘The shawshank redemption’,  the shawshank redemption follows the story of a man named Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins who is sentenced to two life sentences in in the ruthless prison ‘Shawshank’, he is charged with the murder of two people, his wife and her lover. Andy however is innocent of these murders, while incarcerated Andy befriends a man named Red played by Morgan Freeman, experiences the pain and brutality of the prison system, helps the warden and eventually plots and executes his escape from Shawshank all in a 19 year stay. I love this movie because it shows the hope that can be found even in the hardest of times, Andy makes friends and finds a position of power among the warden but always there is the hope of escape and in the end that hope becomes reality.</p>

        <div class="StarWars">
            <p>My next fav movie is actually a set of movies, Star wars! I love star wars more than any other piece of media, the special effects, the atmosphere and world building all of the characters and alien races are excellent, I cannot really explain why I enjoy these movies other than they are fun.</p>

        <div class="JurrasicPark">
            <p>Another of my fav movies is the first and original Jurassic park, it has amazing special effects that still hold up and as a kid i would watch that movie on repeat, it fostered a love for all things dinosaur within me and even helped me to bond with my sister over the movie and its sequels.</p>
